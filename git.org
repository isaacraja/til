* Revert a pull 10 minutes ago
  You can revert a commit that was made sometime before using the following command
  ~git reset --hard master@{"10 minutes ago"}~
* Remove a big file from git history 
  If you accidently commit a big file into git, you'll have problems when pushing to remote that doesn't support git large file system.
  This command just removes it not only from the commit, but also from the history
  #+BEGIN_SRC 
  git filter-branch --force --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch PrimeSlotNov22.sql'  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
  #+END_SRC
